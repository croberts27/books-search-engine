# Book Search Engine

## Description

This project takes a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and refactors it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack, with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API.

The deployed application can be found here: https://graphql-books-search-engine-346db059939b.herokuapp.com/
